# Contributing
All contributions are super-duper welcome. Think a grain of salt would make something better? Just figured out how to make the best cheese sandwich in the world? Create a PR and I will have a look at it! 

## Give credits
Remember to give credits where credit is due. It doesn't matter if it's to your mom, a website or a statue you talked to when you were baked out of your mind. Giving credit is part of not being a dick.
