# Project food
Project food is simply a categorized collection of various recipes served with Markdown (and sometimes cheese). The main purpose of these recipes is to not accidently kill, harm or make any of it's consumers sick - while remaining somewhat tasteful and inspiring. However, as with every open sauce (pun intended) project - it comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
