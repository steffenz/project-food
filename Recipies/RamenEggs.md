If you're anything like me, you love eggs in all styles and shapes. Mix that with a love for asian food, noodles and expecially ramen; and you'll probably love these eggs as much as I do.

Although these eggs usually go in your ramen, I love to have them in salads or just eating them as a snack on their own.

I originally discovered this recipe at [The Flavor Bender](https://www.theflavorbender.com/ramen-eggs-ajitsuke-tamago/), and modified it to fit the ingredients I could find. I do however highly advice you to read the full article which provides much greater detail and variations on how to make these eggs "sparkle with joy". 

## Prerequisites
I'd highly recommend you to pinch a hole in your eggs to make sure they don't crack once you put them in boiling water. I personally prefer to use a dedicated egg boiler for this purpose to ensure the same result each and every time (for my scandinavian readers; I use [this boiler](https://www.obhnordica.no/matlaging/eggkokere/perfect-eggs))

You can usually get Mirin at your local asian grocery store. If you live in Oslo, check out [A Food Market](http://www.asianfood.no/)

## Marinade for 4-5 eggs

- 1.5 dl Mirin
- 0.5 dl Soy Sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar

Mix untill the brown sugar is completely dissolved. Put the mix in the fridge.

## Boiling eggs
You can make the eggs however you like, but I prefer them slightly runny (medium+). Boil time might vary with egg size and altitude (?), but somewhere between 5-7 minutes should be fine. Remember to pinch a hole and put them in the water once it's boiling (or just use an egg boiler like me).

Once finished, put in cold water immediately for 2-3 minutes. 

## Peel, soak and leave
Peel the eggs carefully, and put them in the marinade. Leave them in for 8, 12 or 24 hours (depending on the result you want). I tend to leave them closer to 24 hours.


## Done
That's it. Keep the eggs in the fridge, and try to eat them within a week (shouldn't be difficult). You can re-use the marinade for up to three weeks according to the article at The Flavor Bender which you should totally have read by now.
